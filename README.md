**ComposedLayouts** provides conveniences for using [Composed](http://github.com/composed-swift/composed) with `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout` and `UICollectionViewFlowLayout`.

> Please note this framework is still in a beta phase and since its currenly used in only a handful of projects I've opted not to introduce versioning yet. API is extremely subject to change.
